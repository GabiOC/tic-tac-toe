		<!-- A bitboard is used to represent the game board state. Each grid (or position on the board) is
		assigned a bit (binary/base two, i.e. 2^0 = 1; 2^1 = 2; 2^2 = 4, etc). When each player selects a grid square,
		its position is added to his/her bitboard. To determine the winner, we create a bitboard (represented as an array)
		of the winning combinations by summing the bits horizontally, vertically and diagonally, and perform a bitwise
		'and' operation to compare the player's moves/bitboard vs. the winning combos. If the player's moves equal one of the winning combos,
		he/she is the winner. -->
